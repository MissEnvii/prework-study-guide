A perfect way to use the Prework study guide is to look up certain topics that I'm would struggle on. Each section has inclued notes to refresh my memory. Instead of looking at my scribles in my notebook, i can easily look up topics that i have learned along the way, as weel as add extra notes if needed. 
For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
